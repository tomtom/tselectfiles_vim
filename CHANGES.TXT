  CHANGES:

<c-r> in the list view)
- g:tselectfiles_use_cache, g:tselectfiles_no_cache: Control the use of 
cached file listings
- If no start argument is provided, the starting directory can also be 
defined via b:tselectfiles_dir and g:tselectfiles_dir (use "." to use 
the current directory); this could be used to quickly select 
project-related files
- Key shortcuts to open files in (vertically) split windows or tabs
- <c-c> now is "Copy file names", <c-k> is "Copy files"

- When renaming a file that's loaded, rename also the buffer.
- You can filter the list of selected files via setting the 
[wbg]:tselectfiles_filter_rx variable.
- Renamed g:tselectfiles_no_cache to g:tselectfiles_no_cache_rx
- [bg]:tselectfiles_use_cache and [bg]:tselectfiles_no_cache_rx can now 
also be set per buffer.

0.5
- [wbg]:tselectfiles_filter_rx is used only when no directory is given 
on the command line.
- Require tlib >= 0.18
- If the filename matches an entry in g:tselectfiles_filedescription_rx, 
use the expression there to construct a file description (eg the file's 
first line)
- Option to run vimgrep on selected files.
- tselectfiles#BaseFilter(): Set b:tselectfiles_filter_rx to something 
useful.
- tselectfiles#BaseFilter(): takes 2 optional arguments to substitute a

properly work (thanks to naquad/Daniil F.)

0.10
- :TSelectFiles, :TSelectFilesInSubdirs, tselectfiles#SelectFiles: take 
an initial pattern as the second optional argument (i.e. if you pass a

provided as extra argument
