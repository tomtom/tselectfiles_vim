*tselectfiles.txt*  A simplicistic files selector/browser (sort of)


This plugin provides a simple file browser. It is not a full blown 
explorer but can be nevertheless be useful for quickly selecting a few 
files or renaming them.

As the plugin does some caching in the background, the filelist is only 
generated once for each path or when called with [!]. In conjuncture 
with the use of the [wbg]:tselectfile_filter_rx variable, this provides 
for use as a simple ad-hoc project manager.

EXAMPLE:
When opening a file under "~/vimfiles", I set b:tselectfiles_dir 
to all the relevant directories under "~/vimfiles" and then set 
b:tselectfile_filter_rx = expand('%%:t:r'). Thus, when I open 
"~/vimfiles/plugin/foo.vim", b:tselectfile_filter_rx is "foo", and 
:TSelectFiles shows all the files under "~/vimfiles" matching "foo".

Features:
    - list files (recursively or the in the current directory only), 
      dynamically select files matching a pattern
    - open files
    - preview files
    - rename/move files
    - batch rename/move files (using a regular expression)
    - copy files
    - delete files
    - show file info

Advanced uses:

Related files: If you set |g:tselectfiles_filter_rx| to some appropriate 
value, only files matching that regexp will be shown initially. This can 
be used to restrict the list to "related" files. (The initial filter can 
be removed by pressing <c-bs>.) See also |tselectfiles#BaseFilter()| and 
|g:tselectfiles_part_subst|.

Rolodex: If a filename matches an entry in 
|g:tselectfiles_filedescription_rx| (a dictionnary patter => funcref), 
funcref(filename) will be called to retrieve the file's description. 
This function could be used to extract metadata or selected lines from 
the file etc. By mapping one record onto one file, you would get some 
sort of rolodex-like database. See 
|tselectfiles#FormatVikiMetaDataOrFirstLine()| for an example for 
viki/deplate (vimscript #861) formatted files.
